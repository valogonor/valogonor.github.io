Hi, I'm Valerie Ogonor, a data scientist.

I got my first exposure to data analysis from studying public policy, which involves analyzing data to evaluate the effects of certain policies. One of my policy internships required me to create data visualizations. I found I enjoyed the process of not only analyzing the data, but also creating the visualizations that make it easier to communicate insights from the data analysis.

Soon afterwards, I studied computer science, then data science. Now I'm excited to apply my data analysis, data engineering, and data science skills to new, practical problems. I'd love to work with you to solve business or policy problems using math and code.
